## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide information for use of Peppol tax category codes for an Australian tax invoice or credit note.

### Issue

Peppol uses a subset of the UNCL5305 code list to specify the application of sales/consumption tax (e.g. VAT, GST) for an invoiced item. The PINT A-NZ specification has adopted the following tax category codes:

- **S** â€“ Standard rate  
- **E** â€“ Exempt from tax  
- **Z** â€“ Zero rated goods  
- **G** â€“ Free export item, tax not charged  
- **O** â€“ Services outside scope of tax  

The Australian GST law does not specify GST categories using the UNCL5305 code list. Guidance is therefore required for Digital Service Providers and business end users to clarify the use of these codes for an Australian tax invoice or credit note.

| S            | Standard rate                    | Use this code in the tax invoice for goods and services that are taxable and which attract a non-zero tax rate.<br><br>When using this code to charge tax, the corresponding tax rate shown on the invoice needs to be the legislated percentage, e.g. 10%.<br><br>If you are registered for GST, or required to be, the goods and services you sell in Australia are generally taxable unless they are GST-free or input taxed.<br><br>See [Taxable sales â€“ GST in Australia](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/gst/when-to-charge-gst-(and-when-not-to)/taxable-sales/). |
| E            | Exempt from tax                  | Use this code for goods and services which are input taxed supplies in Australia and don't include GST in the price.<br><br>See [Input-taxed supplies in Australia](https://www.ato.gov.au/business/gst/when-to-charge-gst-(and-when-not-to)/input-taxed-sales/). |
