## Introduction 

This guidance note provides instructions on how Service Providers who
provide Access Point (AP) and Service Metadata Publisher (SMP) services
in Australia and New Zealand can meet the requirements of End User
Identification in the Peppol environment.

Reliability in the identity of end-users provides confidence and trust
in the Peppol network. Adequate identity verification and validation by
Service Providers reduces the risk of fraudulent behaviour which impacts
End Users and can damage the reputation of the network and ultimately,
is detrimental to all parties.

Comprehensive and adequate End User identification considers:

- New End User:

  - that the person representing an entity is who they say they are, and

  - that the person is authorised to represent the entity, and

  - that the entity is legitimate, and the details are accurate.

- Existing End User:

  - triggers that may prompt re-checking the information, and

  - periodic re-checking.

The requirements in this document create a baseline level of validation.
A-NZ Peppol Authorities have been, and continue to, work with Service
Providers to strengthen End User identification as the network matures.

This guidance note should be read in conjunction with *Guidance Note 09
Peppol Directory* available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/A-NZ-PEPPOL/Guidance-documents).

This guidance note replaces *Guidance Note 04 Know Your Customer*,
*Guidance Note 05 ABN Validation* and *Guidance Note 06 NZBN
Validation*. These are now obsolete.

## OpenPeppol Internal Regulations 

Policy for End User identification in OpenPeppol can be found in Section
3.3.1 of the [OpenPeppol Internal
Regulations](https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AF/pages/2756771841/New+Peppol+Agreements+and+accompanying+documents)
(IR).

SPs remain responsible for the correctness of all End User (senders and
receivers) information for the time during which they provide Peppol
Services to them, directly or indirectly through intermediaries.

## Tools

### Australian Business Register (ABR) 

The Australia Business Number (ABN), the End User's name, and other
associated registration details are available on the Australian Business
Register (ABR).

There are options to check and validate details against information on
the ABR, including Web Services and Lookup tools to support integration
into system solutions:

- [ABN Lookup Web
  Services](https://abr.business.gov.au/Tools/WebServices)

- [ABN Lookup tools](https://abr.business.gov.au/Tools/AbnLookup)

- [ABR website search](https://abr.business.gov.au)

- [ATO app](https://abr.business.gov.au/Tools/AtoApp)

### New Zealand Business Number Register (NZBNR) 

The New Zealand Business Number (NZBN), the End User's name, and other
primary business data is available on the NZBN register.

The tools available to check and validate details against the
information on the NZBNR include:

- [NZBN Business Search](https://www.nzbn.govt.nz/)

- [NZBN
  Business-Match](https://www.nzbn.govt.nz/using-the-nzbn/nzbn-services/)
  (for validating existing customer lists)

- [NZBN
  API](https://api.business.govt.nz/api/apis/info?name=NZBN&version=v4&provider=mbiecreator)

- [Further information on NZBN
  services](https://www.nzbn.govt.nz/using-the-nzbn/nzbn-services/) --
  including NZBN Watchlists and Alerts for when business details change.

### Global Location Numbers (GLNs)

The Global Location Number (GLN) is used to identify locations and legal
entities. This unique identifier is comprised of a GS1 Company Prefix,
Location Reference, and Check Digit[^1].

GLN lookup is available on the GS1 website:

- [Search for GLN](https://gepir.gs1.org/index.php/search-by-gln) --
  ensure search returns "query successful"

## Guidance

### Requirements for Service Providers

1.  Documented End User identification process (**Mandatory**)

> Service Providers (SPs) must have a documented process for identifying
> and verifying End User information which includes:

- How information is collected and verified,

- How any data discrepancies will be handled,

- How requests for changes to key information will be managed, and

  - e.g. reverifying the End User where the email address changes.

- How suspicious activity will be managed.

  - e.g. verify the details where there is more than one user with the
    same identifier, or where the identifier has been changed in the
    system.

2.  End User authorisation (**Mandatory**)

> SPs must ensure they are authorised to grant access to the Peppol
> Network to the End User.
