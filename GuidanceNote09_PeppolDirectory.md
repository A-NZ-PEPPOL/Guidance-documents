## Introduction

The Peppol Directory contains information about the receiving
capabilities of End Users participating in Peppol. Its purpose is to
support businesses to find their trading partners who are registered to
exchange documents with them. The reliability of the Peppol Directory
directly impacts its usefulness for this purpose.

Service Providers (SPs) are responsible for keeping this information
accurate and up to date.

This guidance has been developed to support the accuracy of Australian
and New Zealand data in the Peppol Directory.

This guidance note should be read in conjunction with *Guidance Note 10
End User Identification* available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/A-NZ-PEPPOL/Guidance-documents).

---

### Background

Analysis of Australian and New Zealand entries in the Peppol Directory
has found data quality issues including invalid identifiers, cancelled
identifiers, missing fields, and entries that do not correspond with
central registries. This undermines confidence in, and reduces the
reliability and usefulness of, the Peppol Directory.

---

### Requirement to register End Users in the Peppol Directory

In Australia and New Zealand, SPs are required to register and maintain
the receiving capability of End Users in the Peppol Directory. This is
defined in Australia's and New Zealand's [Peppol Authority Specific
Requirements](https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AF/pages/2756772112/List+of+PA+Specific+Requirements+-+2022+update).

---

### OpenPeppol Internal Regulations

Section 4.6.3 of the OpenPeppol [Internal
Regulations](https://openpeppol.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AF/pages/2756771841/New+Peppol+Agreements+and+accompanying+documents)
requires the Service Provider to submit up to date and accurate
information to the SMP(s) in which their End Users' endpoints are
listed.

It also requires that a Service Provider who provides Peppol Addressing
and Lookup Services is responsible for:

- Maintaining the End User's information

- Ensuring the information is displayed accurately, and

- Following up with the service provider who has the primary
  relationship with the End User if there are issues with the
  information provided to the Peppol Directory.
