## Background  
This document provides guidance for Access Point (AP) Providers and Service Metadata Publisher (SMP) Providers in Australia and New Zealand to meet the **Know Your Customer (KYC)** requirements outlined in the **PEPPOL Compliance Policy**. It also includes recommended practices for accounting/invoicing software providers.

KYC validation:

- Ensures reliable identity of end-users  
- Enhances service experience  
- Mitigates risk of bad customer behavior  
- Protects against fraudulent misuse of business identity  

ðŸ“Ž Refer to the ABN and NZBN validation guidance notes for complementary requirements.

---

## Issue  
To maintain trust and integrity in the e-invoicing network, OpenPEPPOL requires all AP and SMP Providers to comply with KYC under Principle 8 of the Compliance Policy:

> *Each AP service provider must have a written service contract with its customers carrying forward the minimum requirements defined by OpenPEPPOL.*

Until formal minimum requirements are defined, this guidance note serves as the baseline for APs and SMPs operating in Australia and New Zealand.

---

## Guidance  
This section outlines the minimum KYC requirements for AP and SMP Providers.

### 1. Customer Identification (**Mandatory**)  
Providers must ensure KYC checks are performed directly or by contracted software providers. Documented processes must include:

- How information is collected and verified  
- How discrepancies are handled  

### 2. Verify Entity Registration (**Mandatory**)  
Validate identifiers and names via:

- [ABN â€“ Australian Business Register](https://abr.business.gov.au)  
- [NZBN â€“ New Zealand Business Number](https://www.nzbn.govt.nz/)  
- [GLN â€“ GS1 Company Database](https://www.gs1.org/services/verified-by-gs1)  
- [DUNS â€“ D-U-N-S Number Lookup](https://businesscredit.dnb.com/business-glossary/duns-number/)

> Existing customers must be verified within 18 months if not previously validated.

### 3. Verify Representative (**Recommended**)  
Suggested methods:

- Entityâ€™s official contact channels  
- Public registers (e.g. ASIC, NZ Companies Register)  
- Confirmation from office holders  
- Evidence of business activity (e.g. bank, tax agent, utility bills)

### 4. Updating Key Information (**Mandatory**)  
If customer records are updated, repeat identification and verification steps.
