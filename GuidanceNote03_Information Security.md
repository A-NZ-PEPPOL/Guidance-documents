## Introduction 

The European PEPPOL framework has been formally adopted by both the New
Zealand and Australian governments for e-Invoicing. The framework will
provide businesses with the opportunity to fully digitise the invoicing
process allowing them to pay invoices faster, reduce incidents of fraud
and refuse costs associated with invoice handling.

While several mitigations are inherent in the OpenPEPPOL framework, an
analysis of the threat landscape has identified additional controls
required to respond to a number of risks rated as high. These risks can
be summarised in the threat statement below.

*An external threat actor or insider motivated by financial profit, a
desire to cause business disruption, state sponsored or industrial
espionage, accesses an element of the e-Invoicing process. They then
modify or collect business and invoice data as it is being processed,
stored or transmitted by the systems involved in e-Invoicing. This
results in financial losses for the affected businesses, attention from
the media, a loss of stakeholder confidence in the e-Invoicing process
and poor uptake of e-Invoicing by businesses due to the perceived
risks.*

## Scope

The A-NZ Information Security Program applies to all e-Invoicing service
providers, that provide (or are seeking to provide) Access Point and/or
Service Metadata Publisher services.

Large organisations with diverse service/product offerings, may limit
the scope of the information security program to relevant policies,
procedures and systems of the business unit responsible for the
e-Invoicing Access Point / Service Metadata Publisher service.

## Objectives 

The Information Security is a collective obligation of the PEPPOL
Service Providers and the A-NZ PEPPOL Authorities.

This Information security guidance has below collective objectives

- Increased trust and assurance

- Reduce Security related incidents

- Less or no reputational damage

- Apply PEPPOL regulatory compliance

## Key Requirements

Section 2.1 of the Annex 5 within the Transport Infrastructure
Agreement, requires *PEPPOL SMP and AP Providers must comply with any
security requirements defined by the PEPPOL Authority. PEPPOL SMP and AP
Providers will be required to provide evidence of compliance against the
requirements for accreditation and demonstrate their continued
compliance to maintain their accreditation.*

The below table describes the information security requirements required
by e-Invoicing Service Providers.

## Further Guidance

### Self-certification or independent certification against either ISO/IEC 27001 or ASD ISM/NZ ISM

#### **Self- certification**

The self-certification requirement seeks to provide the PEPPOL Authority
with a level of assurance that Service Providers have robust security
practices in place. This is done by way of self-certifying against one
of the below standards:

- ISO/IEC 27001

- ASD ISM / NZ ISM

The scope of certification **should** cover relevant organisational
policies, procedures and data repositories that hold or manage PEPPOL
BIS information.

A-NZ PEPPOL Authorities do not expect Service Providers to be fully
compliant with the complete range of controls of your chosen standard.
The controls that Service Providers should be compliant with will be
dependent on operating model and the architecture of solution. We also
acknowledge there may be areas where Service Providers are unable to
demonstrate compliance with particular controls. In these scenarios
Service Provider will be required to offer supporting commentary to
substantiate the non-compliance or the manner / timeframe in which
Service Provider expect to address the gap.

Where Service Providers deem a control not applicable a short
description should be provided as rational behind the inapplicability.

Service Providerâ€™s self-certification **should** be reviewed at
prescribed intervals or when significant changes occur within the
environment. For the purpose of meeting the requirement for
self-certification, Service Provider must review self-certification
annually and resubmit an updated version every 2 years. Where Service
Provider have had a significant change in environment which affects the
controls that have addressed as part of self-certification, Service
Providers are required to submit a revised version to the PEPPOL
Authority as soon as possible.

The A-NZ PEPPOL Authority is unable to prescribe which of the above
methods Service Providers **should** use. The choice of what standard to
self-certify against should be made on the basis of suitability to
Service Provider Solution.

Service Providers are able to request to use an alternative security
standard if Service Provider believes it would be more suitable for your
circumstances. These requests will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Evidence required for Self-Certification

Completed documentation demonstrating your conformance with the
requirements (full control suite) of one of the approved security
standards including comments on why certain controls may or may not be
applicable to Service Provider and how controls that do apply are
addressed by Service Provider

### Independent Certification

The independent certification requirement seeks to provide the A-NZ
PEPPOL Authority with a level of assurance that Service Providers have
robust security practices in place.

This is done by way of attaining independent certification against one
of the below standards:

- ISO/IEC 27001

- ASD ISM / NZ ISM

The scope of independent certification should cover Service Provider
information security practices and below mentioned areas

- Risk Management

- Auditing and Logging

- Monitoring & Reporting

- Vendor Management

Large organisations with diverse service / product offerings, may limit
the scope of the certification to relevant policies, procedures and
systems of the business unit responsible for the primary products or
services which hold or transact e-Invoicing related information.

We donâ€™t expect Service Provider to be fully compliant with the complete
range of controls. The controls that Service Providers **should** be
compliant will be dependent on operating model and the architecture of
the Solution. We also acknowledge there may be areas where Service
Providers are unable to demonstrate compliance with particular controls.
In these scenarios Service Provider will be required to offer supporting
commentary to substantiate the non-compliance or the manner / timeframe
in which you expect to address the address the gap.

Where Service Providers deem a control not applicable this should be
addressed in the statement of applicability.

Service Provider independent certification **should** be reviewed at
prescribed intervals or when significant changes occur within your
environment. For the purpose of meeting the PEPPOL framework requirement
for independent certification, Service Provider must maintain
independent certification on going. This evidence needs to be supplied
to the PEPPOL Authority. Where you have had a significant change in your
environment which affects the controls you have addressed as part of
your independent certification, Service Provider **mus**t submit a
revised version to the PEPPOL Authority as soon as possible.

The A-NZ PEPPOL Authority is unable to prescribe which of the above
methods Service Providers **should** use or provide links to them. The
choice of standard to complete independent certification should be made
on the basis of suitability to Service Provider.

Evidence required

- Completed documentation demonstrating your conformance with the
  requirements (full control suite) of one of the approved security
  standards outlined above.

- Statement of Applicability

- Letter of Compliance

- Copy of certificate upon completion of independent certification

### Encryption at rest

This requirement seeks to protect e-Invoicing related information from
unauthorised access.

You can chose to apply encryption at the disk, container, application or
database level. Encryption at rest should follow the relevant
cryptographic controls outlined in the [ASD
ISM](https://www.cyber.gov.au/ism) or [NZ
ISM](https://www.gcsb.govt.nz/publications/the-nz-information-security-manual/).

Evidence required

- Screenshot showing encryption enabled at the database or disk level
  with the type of encryption at rest being used

- When using â€˜out of the boxâ€™ encryption a licensing agreement or
  screenshot showing â€˜out of the boxâ€™ encryption at rest enabled

- If using the infrastructure of a cloud provider to encrypt data at
  rest, an invoice or contract agreement could be provided or screenshot
  from within the cloud environment showing encryption enabled.

Where encryption at rest is not viable, evidence must be provided of a
full range of data protection controls.

These **must** include:

- User/system (service account) access control (including authentication
  and authorisation) and active logging and monitoring protocols

- Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System

- Internal employee screening or vetting

- Isolation of/and handling procedures for sensitive data (ie invoice
  data) including restrictions such as â€˜need to knowâ€™ principles.

### Security monitoring practices

This requirement seeks to detect and respond to cyber-attacks, channel
misuse and business threats. Monitoring is a joint responsibility
between the A-NZ PEPPOL Authority and Service Provider. Service
Providers need to be able to demonstrate that they scan their
environment for threats and take appropriate action when they detect
anomalies.

Evidence required

Network / infrastructure layer - relevant combinations of:

- screen shots of an intrusion detection system or firewall that
  generates alerts . If a service provider uses a third party a
  screenshot from within the solution showing the monitoring
  capabilities, dashboard etc.

- photos of your Security information and event management dashboard

- If leveraging off a cloud provider you can provide either an invoice
  or screenshot from within the environment showing the type of
  monitoring captured.

Application layer â€“ relevant combinations of:

- screen shots of the function page in the application, and

- reports from the backend system.

Transaction (data) layer â€“ relevant combinations of:

- reports from the backend system

- Screenshots of an anomaly detection system.

### Encryption in transit for all e-Invoicing information (business documents) sent and received by an Access Point

This requirement seeks to protect the confidentiality and integrity of
information in transit.

You will need to provide evidence that you use an approved cryptographic
protocol (for example, TLS 1.2) and algorithm to encrypt data in transit
as per [AUS](https://www.cyber.gov.au/ism) or
[NZ](https://www.gcsb.govt.nz/publications/the-nz-information-security-manual/)
Information security Manual.

**Evidence required**

Screenshot of one or more of the below:

- SSL certificates

- Showing HTTPS protocol being enforced

- Call to API

- TLS handshake protocol being enforced.

### Multifactor authentication

This requirement seeks to minimise the opportunity for unauthorised
users to client related information.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is defined as a method of
authentication that uses two or more authentication factors from
different categories, to authenticate a single claimant to a single
authentication verifier.

The authentication factors can be categorised as:

- Something you know, such as a password or a response to a security
  question

- Something you have, such as a one-time pin, SMS message, smartcard, or
  software certificate

- Something you are, such as biometric data, like a fingerprint or
  userâ€™s voice

Further information on each method can be found at [ACSC Protect:
Multi-factor authentication
(PDF)](https://acsc.gov.au/publications/protect/Multi_Factor_Authentication.pdf)

For access point controlled products or services the following
circumstance is an example of when MFA is ***not mandatory*** but is
highly recommended (note: this is not an exhaustive list).

Note

- AP employees are those staff (including contractors) working for or on
  behalf of the AP.

- Tokens or temporary credential should be isolated to an individual
  device and expire once used. Any token or temporary credential should
  expire within 24 hours.

- APs that have not implemented MFA, should consider implementing good
  passphrase practices including single factor authentication controls,
  account lockouts, resetting passphrases, session and screen locking as
  described in the [ASD ISM](https://www.cyber.gov.au/ism) or [NZ
  ISM](https://www.gcsb.govt.nz/publications/the-nz-information-security-manual/).

- A privileged user is defined as a user who can alter or circumvent a
  systemâ€™s security measures â€“ this may include the capability to modify
  system configurations, account privileges, audit logs, data files or
  applications.

**Evidence required**

User manual, user description or instruction paired with screen shots of
the user interface.
