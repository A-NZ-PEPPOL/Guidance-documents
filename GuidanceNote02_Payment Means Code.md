## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide instructions on how commonly used payment methods in Australia and New Zealand (A-NZ), that do not appear in the [payment means code list (UNCL4461)](https://docs.peppol.eu/poac/aunz/pint-aunz/trn-invoice/codelist/UNCL4461/), should be implemented in the [PINT A-NZ](https://docs.peppol.eu/poac/aunz/) (Billing and Self-billing) messages.

> **Note:** The PINT A-NZ specifications support common business practice by allowing multiple (different) payment methods to be included in an invoice/credit note (`cac:PaymentMeans` [(IBG-16)](https://docs.peppol.eu/poac/aunz/pint-aunz/trn-invoice/semantic-model/ibg-16/)).

---

## Issue

The current [UNCL4461 code list](https://docs.peppol.eu/poac/aunz/pint-aunz/trn-invoice/codelist/UNCL4461/) used in the PINT A-NZ specifications for element `cac:PaymentMeans/cbc:PaymentMeansCode` [(IBT-081)](https://docs.peppol.eu/poac/aunz/pint-aunz/trn-invoice/semantic-model/ibt-081/) does not cover some frequently used payment methods or channels in A-NZ. For example; BPAY, BPAY View, Post Billpay, a website URL / URI or other payment channels using the new payment platform (NPP).


Each payment method requires a different set of information to be provided. For example, BPAY requires the biller code and reference number to be supplied. Guidance is therefore required to specify how the information should be conveyed in existing elements. 

---

## Guidance
The recommended solution, described in the sections below, explains how to utilise existing Payment Means Codes to identify the payment platform used and map the customer-specific information to the relevant invoice elements.

The PINT A-NZ specifications include the following fields for Payment Means:

| ID      | Lvl | Attribute name                    | Cardinality | Description                                                                                      |

## Common Payment Means
 
### Credit transfer (30)
 
Credit transfer is one of the most common payment means. Payment channels such as BPAY, BPAY View and Post Billpay fall into this category.
 
This document provides guidance on how to include payment channel-specific fields (e.g. Biller Code or PayID) as the PINT A-NZ specifications do not define how to use these fields.
 
It is recommended to include the payee‚Äôs account name ([IBT-085](https://docs.peppol.eu/poac/aunz/pint-aunz/trn-invoice/semantic-model/ibt-085/)) to enable Confirmation of Payee verification to be completed.  For more information on Confirmation of Payee initiatives, refer to [Australian Payments Plus](https://www.auspayplus.com.au/confirmation-payee) or [GetVerified](https://www.getverified.co.nz/) for New Zealand.
 
### Direct debit (49)
 
Where a direct debit has been agreed between a supplier and buyer, it is recommended to use code ‚Äò49 - Direct Debit‚Äô. Direct debit is a payment, via Direct Entry, where the account holder (payer) authorises another bank (that of the payee) to debit a fixed or variable amount directly from the payer‚Äôs bank account.
 
When using code ‚Äò49‚Äô, an invoice should have only one occurrence of `*cac:PaymentMeans*`. ([IBG-16](https://docs.peppol.eu/poac/aunz/pint-aunz/trn-invoice/semantic-model/ibg-16/)) The direct debit reference number (`*cac:PaymentMandate/cbc:ID*`) ([IBT-089](https://docs.peppol.eu/poac/aunz/pint-aunz/trn-invoice/semantic-model/ibt-089/)) must also be included. If it is not relevant or not available, it is suggested to put ‚Äú`NA`‚Äù in the field.
 
An example is provided below.

# UBL examples
 
## Credit transfer
 
A credit transfer is a payment where the account holder authorises the bank to pay a fixed or variable amount directly to a supplier‚Äôs bank account.
 
These payments are commonly made using a Bank State Branch (BSB) and Account number. An account name is often required for verification.
 
The following example demonstrates how the PINT A-NZ data model can be used to convey the required information to support a credit transfer to a domestic bank.

## New Zealand

In New Zealand, it is common business practice to provide the combined bank account details (Bank, Branch, Account Number, Suffix), shown as a 16-digit number.
